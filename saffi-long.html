                            <p>Transporting bulk olive oil from the grocery to the pantry can be a messy endeavor. Most people who do it have a solution they’ve developed for themselves. However, many people would like to benefit from the lower cost, higher
                                quality and sustainability of purchasing bulk olive oil (as well as other liquid products). </p>

                            <h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
                            <p>We developed a product system that makes dispensing and transporting bulk olive oil from grocery to kitchen.

                            <h4>Goals</h4>

                                Create an easier, more delightful experience for people to transport bulk olive oil from the grocery to the kitchen. Have two modes for the container: Travel and Display

                    <h4>My Contribution</h4>
                    <p>I planned and conducted field visits with the client and other team memebers. I collaborated with the team to plan and conduct user interviews; some were at home, others were on-site and all were either semi-structured or unstructured
                        in the initial phase. I built physical prototypes and helped migrate those to Rhino3D for modeling. I collaborated with the other members to produce final 3D prints. I also planned and executed usability testing with our prototypes
                        at several levels of the process and conducted more structured interviews during the evaluation phase of development.
                        <br><br> Throughout the project I collaborated with our team on concept development and product direction. During interviews and field visits, I kept detailed notes and audio recordings of our research process. I maintained photographic
                        documentation of fieldwork and our prototyping process throughout all levels of the project.

                        <p>Consistent with our domain research, we decided to focus on helping <span class="highlight highlight-walker">parents of late adolescents</span> because children in their early adolescence cannot understand certain personal finance
                            knowledge. It is also critical for late adolescents to learn that knowledge before they start to face real-world financial decisions.<br><br> From our expert interviews, we also learned something unexpected--<span class="highlight highlight-walker">it was
                                premature for us to assume that only teenagers need help with personal finance
                                management</span>. Emerging adults, those between 18 and 25 years old, also do not know how to manage their own financial resources. <br><br> Therefore, we eventually focused our research on <span class="highlight highlight-walker">both parents of late
                                adolecents, and emerging
                                adults</span>.

                                <li>Impulse buying seems to be a major problem for emerging adults.</li>

                            <p>Several participants also pointed out that <span class="highlight highlight-walker">visualizing one's future financial conditions
                                    based on current saving/spending behaviors might not make sense for emerging
                                    adults</span>. People between 18 and 25 are generally in the process of choosing a field of study or exploring career opportunities; it's usually unclear to them how their financial conditions might change depending
                                on their careers changes.
                                <span class="highlight highlight-walker">As a result, Concept 2 might not seem
                                    appealing to emerging adults.</span> However, participants did mention that having a short-term financial status analysis feature (with no long-term goal setting) is beneficial. Therefore,
                                we incorporated the short-term financial status analysis feature into our final design.

                        <p>We also derived several <span class="highlight highlight-walker">design
                                implications</span> from participants' feedback on Concept 1 and Concept 2. Here are some examples:</p>
